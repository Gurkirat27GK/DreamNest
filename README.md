DreamNest
Introduction
DreamNest is a full-stack rental property web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The platform enables seamless interaction between property seekers and owners, allowing users to list, search, and book rental properties. It provides an intuitive, mobile-responsive interface with robust backend support, solving the problem of scattered and inefficient rental property discovery and management.
